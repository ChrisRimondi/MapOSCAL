"""
This module provides custom, as well as tool-based inspection of a file/module to allow
a more accurate inspection of capabilities.  Created to be modular and community-driven,
each file type (e.g., '.py') has a dedicated inspector (e.g., inspect-lang-python).  In
addition, tooling-based inspectors (e.g., Semgrep, etc.) are also available as plugins.
This module should only be treated as a gateway or router, with the type-specific analysis
being performed by the appropriate modules, which in-turn return data here for formatting and
inclusion as part of the overall picture.

File inspection is accomplished at a file (NOT chunk) level, and the results are stored as
part of the _summary_meta.json file, with details under each file path key.  This is due
to the necessity to have these details at a file level, and not a chunked subset (such as those
found in the _meta.json).  Additionally, file-level is required as external scanners don't function
on subsets of data, but generally require a working/valid file to analyse.

Each inspector receives a file path to the file to be inspected.  It then parses the file to
return a defined dictionary of key information:
    1. Modules loaded
    2. File system interactions
    3. Network connections
      a. Ports used
      b. Protocols used
      c. Cryptographic coverage
    4. Cryptographic operations / ciphers
      a. Library used
      b. Algorithm/cipher used
      c. Key length
    5. Identified vulnerabilities
    6. Access control enforcement
      a. Role checks
      b. ACLs and usage validation
      c. Session timeouts, cookie usage, token expiration
    7. Authentication and authorization
      a. Storage of passwords
      b. Existence of hard-coded secrets
      c. MFA integration
      d. Password storage
    8. Input validation
      a. Data input validation
    9. System logging
      a. Logging frameworks 
      b. Log level
      c. Log file contents
        i. Likely sensitive log file contents
    10. Error handling
      a. DLP

Syntax returned by each inspector is below.
file_path = {
                TODO
            }

Once the results are returned they are stored in the summary_meta.json file, which is later parsed
by the control_mapper.get_relevent_chunks() and included in the overall assessment.


TODO: We need to have an awareness of a control mapping structure...
Using this information, a separate mapping structure in used to tag each file with a compliance
flag for hints of control applicability (e.g., NIST 800-53's SC-9 for cryptographic operations).
