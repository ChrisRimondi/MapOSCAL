from maposcal.inspectors import inspect_lang_python

"""
This module provides custom, as well as tool-based inspection of a file/module to allow
a more accurate inspection of capabilities.  Created to be modular and community-driven,
each file type (e.g., '.py') has a dedicated inspector (e.g., inspect-lang-python).  In
addition, tooling-based inspectors (e.g., Semgrep, etc.) are also available as plugins.
This module should only be treated as a gateway or router, with the type-specific analysis
being performed by the appropriate modules, which in-turn return data here for formatting and
inclusion as part of the overall picture.

File inspection is accomplished at a file (NOT chunk) level, and the results are stored as
part of the _summary_meta.json file, with details under each file path key.  This is due
to the necessity to have these details at a file level, and not a chunked subset (such as those
found in the _meta.json).  Additionally, file-level is required as external scanners don't function
on subsets of data, but generally require a working/valid file to analyse.

Each inspector receives a file path to the file to be inspected.  It then parses the file to
return a defined dictionary of key information.  The syntax returned by each inspector is in
the below format for consistent data parsing and usage.
