  "explanation": "The analyzed codebase for the Tiny-HTTP service lacks any implementation of encryption or integrity protection mechanisms such as TLS/SSL for transmitted data. There are no configuration files indicating that encryption is enabled or can be enabled through configuration. The server accepts plain TCP connections and transmits data without confidentiality or integrity safeguards, exposing transmitted information to interception and tampering.",
