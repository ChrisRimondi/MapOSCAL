  "description": "The information system protects the confidentiality and integrity of transmitted information.",
  "status": "gap",
  "explanation": "The reviewed code and configuration reveal that the system implements a basic TCP/HTTP server without any encryption or integrity-protection mechanisms (such as TLS). There is no evidence of the use of secure communication protocols or configuration files enabling transmission confidentiality and integrity. Therefore, the system does not currently protect the confidentiality or integrity of transmitted information, which represents a significant security gap.",
